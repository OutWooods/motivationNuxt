Started work on this at 11:15am with light lunch break. 
Worked at: British library (got a desk)

#### What Went Well
- Alot more productive in the library, more focused. 
- Starting off projects is slow, especially with a new tech.
- Avoiding testing was a good move (shocker!) as it helped me focus on learning. 


#### Even Better If (with action to improve under ) 
 Issue: Had planned more time to refactor/tidy code 
 Solution to test: I have added this into my work
 
 Issue: Wish I was more organised with this project/started earlier 
 Solution to test: Making myself leave the house to code is something I should do more.
 
 Issue: Felt like I was bombarded with new information, first hour was alot of time wasting as I struggled to identify what was my first step. 
 Solution to test: Its normal to be slow with new tech at first, so be more forgiving. Take more breaks when stuck (e.g. 20 min stuck, take a break rule.)
 
 
#### Next Step
- Finish off MVP
- Add in mySQL to the project
- Look if I need to add a backend (to interact with the DB)
- Look into tailwind Apply
- Reflect on structure and identify improvements

Started work on this at 8:00am on off today. With a total of 3 hours work tops. Minimal code, mainly research. 
Worked at: Parents house, living wrong

#### What Went Well
- Didn't rush into programming, but doing more planning about the architecture and structure
- I started to get blocked because I was overloading, reading lots of articles and watching videos. So I then noted down all the questions I had before I could make a design decision/know it would work to use Laravel as an API backend. Then made sure I answered them. 
- Learnt alot about application architecture and authentication. But also, really clearly identified my gaps in knowledge. 


#### Even Better If (with action to improve under ) 
 Issue: Less motivated to work on CSS/Code refactor. 
 Solution to test: Going to do CSS in smaller chunks, rather than bigger blocks (siesters between learning). Code refactor as I go rather than a fixed time. 
 
 Issue: Hard to focus at times (noise, people wondering about)
 Solution to test: Going into a different room to work, or going to a cafe to work. 
 
 Issue: Felt like I was bombarded with new information, first hour was alot of time wasting as I struggled to identify what was my first step. 
 Solution to test: Keep noting down questions I have as I go. Limit learnign time without coding to 1 hour - 1.5 hours max. 
 
 
#### Next Step
- Add in mySQL to the project
- Look if I need to add a backend (to interact with the DB)
- Test and setup authentication (try to avoid using loads of packages, and stick to just Passport and well maintained stuff)
- Get the front and back talking, then get them to do something useful.

General note: Discovered a much more efficient way to make new vue elements with v-for. 

This means I can refactor alot of my code down.

Though it really did help me understand Vue components a bit better to use the Vue mount. So that was helpful)
