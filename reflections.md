Started work on this at 11:15am with light lunch break. 
Worked at: British library (got a desk)

#### What Went Well
- Alot more productive in the library, more focused. 
- Starting off projects is slow, especially with a new tech.
- Avoiding testing was a good move (shocker!) as it helped me focus on learning. 


#### Even Better If (with action to improve under ) 
 Issue: Had planned more time to refactor/tidy code 
 Solution to test: I have added this into my work
 
 Issue: Wish I was more organised with this project/started earlier 
 Solution to test: Making myself leave the house to code is something I should do more.
 
 Issue: Felt like I was bombarded with new information, first hour was alot of time wasting as I struggled to identify what was my first step. 
 Solution to test: Its normal to be slow with new tech at first, so be more forgiving. Take more breaks when stuck (e.g. 20 min stuck, take a break rule.)
 
 
#### Next Step
- Finish off MVP
- Add in mySQL to the project
- Look if I need to add a backend (to interact with the DB)
- Look into tailwind Apply
- Reflect on structure and identify improvements
