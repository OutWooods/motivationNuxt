# What??!

This is the second of the 3 nuxt projects. (*Cooler name coming soon*).

This is one of three competeing repos of mine. They may all die, or be finished uncompleted. But they're all about just dipping into
and playing about with vue, nuxt and some other libraries I thought looked cool. 

The reason I decided to approach it like this, is that I'm crazy prone to thinking of an idea, starting it. Setting it up. And then 
having a new idea the next day and abandoning it. So, I spent 3 weeks, writing down all the random ideas I had. Saw which I spent the
most time thinking about, and then marked them as the big three that I would test out. 

The next three weeks I'm only allowed to do these three projects, but I can do whatever ones I want of them. And over time, hopefully, 
one will turn out to reign supreme. 

### So whats this one?

This is a motivation, or target tracking site. Essentially, when you meet a target you get to fill in a pixl in a screen. 
Gradualy over time these build up and up as a measure of your success. So you get a satisfying image as you achieve. 
Hopefully also the pixels move and form a mini-universe, with sounds to make it even cooler. 

I felt this was a nice balance as its little enough that you don't just do it 'to get points' (as I find this works 
for a short period of time, but ineffective to build long term motivation to do habits) but also gives you a sense of pride 
over time. It also motivates me to log my goals, which I am not great at, and I know massively increases my ability to meet targets anyway. 

This was heavily influenced by the project (insert link here). As they produced a pretty awesome looking website. I also wanted to learn about
gravity.js and javascript sound libraries. 


### Steps to MVP 
- [X] You can add squares of one colour and fill in the screen
- [X] You can add squares when you achieve one colour
- [ ] You can add new targets, and choose corresponding colours (type in the 3 rgb values) or random 
- [ ] Refactor and tidy up of code
- [ ] CSS

- [ ] You can't use the same colour more than once 
- [ ] You can only meet a target once a day 
- [ ] You can only add one new target a day 
- [ ] You can delete targets

###  Next steps after 
- [ ] The Pixls have motion
- [ ] They hit each other 
- [ ] They make noises when they touch 
- [ ] Special shapes for stages (e.g. 10 days in a row) 
- [ ] You can click on one and see the timestamp
- [ ] You can click and see the goal
- [ ] You can add possitive notes
- [ ] You can see the notes randomly
- [ ] When you get a random note, the target is highlighted 
- [ ] You can only set five new goals a week 
- [ ] Reflection page 
- [ ] Goals you missed yesterday, you get a little pop up, where you can add a reflection 
- [ ] You can set a different time for reflections 

#### Random future ideas
- [ ] Multiple universes
- [ ] Merge dots together
- [ ] Center of gravity 
- [ ] Size affects speed
- [ ] Cool messafes 
- [ ] Timeline of your goals as balls of colour 
- [ ] Can mark a goal as 'special' as one you're particularly proud of (can only do one a day)

#### How to run

You will need node and npm installed before doing this.

- clone this repo ```git clone https://github.com/Tagrand/motivationNuxt.git```
- go inside ```cd motivationNuxt```
- run ```npm install```
- run ```nuxt```  (this starts your local server)
- go to localhost:3000
- Enjoy!
